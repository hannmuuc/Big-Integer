# Big-Integer
create a a class of Big-Integer

use this class to compute the factorial With the time complexity of O(nlognlogn).

the Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are implemented  \br
the Addition and subtraction can be computed With the time complexity of O(n).
the multiplication and division can be computed With the time complexity of O(nlogn).
but the precision of division must be concerned
