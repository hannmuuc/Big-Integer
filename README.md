# Big-Integer
create a a class of Big-Integer<br>

use this class to compute the factorial With the time complexity of O(nlognlogn).<br>

the Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are implemented<br>
the Addition and subtraction can be computed With the time complexity of O(n).<br>
the multiplication and division can be computed With the time complexity of O(nlogn).but the precision of division must be concerned<br>
